  "description": "Join us in for a webinar to discuss about different visions and experiences of net.art in the 90s as well as to see three new artworks from Asian, Latin American, and European artists in respond to the issue of embodied interface.\n\nLooking back with great enthusiasm on a productive and special artist-in-residence at Sundaymoring@EKWC in Oisterwijk, The Netherlands. In which I was able to further develop my project Nature- / Databody and ‘Error in Defoliation’. During the residency I made 3D prints from CT-scan of my vital organs (brain, kidney, heart etc.) in porcelain. And new objects in ceramics for the performance-installation ‘Error in Defoliation’. Both projects will be further developed in 2021.",
