description: But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of
  the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
  truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
  avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
  know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
  extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
  to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
  circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
  pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
  physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
  right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
  annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
  pleasure?
